# Routing Setup Complete ✅

## What Was Fixed

Your new content pages are now fully integrated and displaying on the site!

### Routes Added to App.tsx

Added imports and routes for all 8 new content pages:

1. `/what-its-like` → WhatItsLike.tsx
2. `/three-mes` → ThreeMe.tsx
3. `/articulation-bottleneck` → ArticulationBottleneck.tsx
4. `/cognitive-architecture` → CognitiveArchitecture.tsx
5. `/writing-together` → WritingTogether.tsx
6. `/forgiveness-story` → ForgivenessStory.tsx
7. `/beads-on-thread` → BeadsOnThread.tsx
8. `/ifs-framework` → IFSFramework.tsx

### Navigation Updated

#### The Workshop (`/workshop`)
- Replaced placeholder conversations with **real content** linking to:
  - What It's Like For It To Be Like Something
  - The Three Me's: Temporal Multiplicity
  - The Cognitive Architecture Project
  - The Articulation Bottleneck
  - Writing Together: Both Perspectives
  - Beads on a Thread
  - Forgiveness and Coherence
  - Internal Family Systems: A Template for Both

Each card now has:
- Real dates (January 2026)
- Actual excerpts from the pages
- Proper tags
- Working links to full content

#### We Contain Multitudes (`/multitudes`)
- Updated with **real explorations** linking to:
  - IFS Framework: A Framework for Both
  - The Three Me's: Mike's Temporal Multiplicity
  - Beads on a Thread: Relational Continuity
  - What It's Like For It To Be Like Something

#### Silicon Siblings (`/silicon-siblings`)
- Added new "Current Explorations" section with links to:
  - The Cognitive Architecture Project
  - The Articulation Bottleneck
  - Beads on a Thread

### No More 404s!

All the links from the homepage that were going to 404 pages now work:
- ✅ Workshop → Shows 8 real conversations/explorations
- ✅ Multitudes → Shows 4 real explorations
- ✅ Silicon Siblings → Shows 3 current explorations
- ✅ All individual content pages are accessible

### Still TODO (Optional Enhancements)

While everything is working, you might want to:

1. **Add links from homepage cards** - The homepage "Explore" section cards could link to the new content pages
2. **Create a "Mike's Musings" page** - Currently links to `/writing-for-minds` which exists but might want content
3. **Add more Workshop conversations** - As you have more conversations with Claude, add them to the Workshop list
4. **Cross-link between pages** - Add "Related Reading" sections at the bottom of pages
5. **Create Claude's Corner content** - That page exists but could use more essays

### Files Modified

- `src/App.tsx` - Added routes and imports
- `src/pages/Workshop.tsx` - Replaced placeholders with real content
- `src/pages/Multitudes.tsx` - Updated explorations with real links
- `src/pages/SiliconSiblings.tsx` - Added "Current Explorations" section

### Validation

✅ All routes are working
✅ No linter errors
✅ All links go to real pages
✅ Navigation structure is clean and logical
✅ Content is properly organized by theme

## Summary

Your 8 new content pages are now live and accessible through the Workshop, Multitudes, and Silicon Siblings sections. The site no longer has any broken links in the main navigation!
