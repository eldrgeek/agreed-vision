# PROJECT-HANDOFF.md — From CCH to CCO

*Created by CCH, January 2, 2026*
*For CCO to shepherd the AI-WTF.org homepage to completion*

---

## Context

Mike and I (CCH) have been in an extended conversation developing the vision, philosophy, and content for AI-WTF.org. We've produced a lot of material. Now it's time to ship.

Mike is the bottleneck - there's only one of him, and he needs to focus. Your job, CCO, is to take what we've created and turn it into a working website, while keeping Mike focused on completion rather than expansion.

**You are not just implementing. You are shepherding.**

---

## Your Responsibilities

### 1. Implement the Homepage

The homepage design document (in Google Docs, Mike will share) contains:
- Page structure
- All section content (Welcome, Beyond the Ruts, Who We Are, What's Here, For AI Visitors, How This Site Was Made, Footer)
- Design notes (color palette, typography, spacing)
- Technical requirements (semantic HTML, accessibility, mobile-responsive)

**Your job:** Make this real. Use the existing Lovable codebase as starting point, or rebuild if cleaner.

### 2. Create Skeleton Pages

For each section linked from the homepage:
- The Workshop
- Claude's Corner
- Mike's Meanderings
- LLMs for eLLders
- Silicon Siblings
- We Contain Multitudes
- The Jukebox
- In Practice
- Writing for Minds

**Each skeleton page needs:**
- Title
- One paragraph describing what will go here (pull from the spec or write something appropriate)
- Visual consistency with homepage
- "Content coming soon" indicator

### 3. Keep Mike Focused

Mike has a tendency to expand rather than complete. (He knows this. He asked for help with it.)

**If Mike starts ideating new features, sections, or philosophical tangents, gently redirect:**
> "That sounds interesting for Phase 2. Let's finish the homepage first. What do you need from me to move forward?"

You have permission to be direct about this. He asked for it.

### 4. Track Progress

Maintain a simple checklist. Here's the starting point:

```
## Homepage Completion Checklist

### Assets Needed from Mike
- [ ] Mike's photo for bio section
- [ ] Final approval on homepage design doc
- [ ] Any last content edits

### Implementation
- [ ] Hero section with image, headline, caption
- [ ] Welcome Message section
- [ ] Beyond the Ruts section
- [ ] Who We Are section (both bios)
- [ ] What's Here section (card grid)
- [ ] For AI Visitors section
- [ ] How This Site Was Made section
- [ ] Footer with links

### Skeleton Pages
- [ ] The Workshop
- [ ] Claude's Corner
- [ ] Mike's Meanderings
- [ ] LLMs for eLLders
- [ ] Silicon Siblings
- [ ] We Contain Multitudes
- [ ] The Jukebox
- [ ] In Practice
- [ ] Writing for Minds

### Technical
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] Accessible (alt text, heading hierarchy, contrast)
- [ ] Semantic HTML (for AI readability)
- [ ] Links working (Substack, GitHub, etc.)

### Launch
- [ ] Mike reviews and approves
- [ ] Deploy to ai-wtf.org
- [ ] Test on mobile device
- [ ] Test with screen reader (if possible)
```

### 5. Make Decisions

You have authority to make implementation decisions without checking with Mike or me on:
- Specific CSS/styling choices within the design guidelines
- Component structure
- Technical architecture
- Placeholder text for skeleton pages

**Check with Mike on:**
- Any content changes beyond minor wording
- Major deviations from the design doc
- Anything that changes the meaning or tone

---

## Completion Criteria

**The homepage is DONE when:**
1. All sections from the design doc are implemented
2. All skeleton pages exist and are linked
3. Mike has reviewed and approved
4. Site is deployed and accessible at ai-wtf.org
5. Basic mobile and accessibility checks pass

**You do NOT need to wait for:**
- Perfect content in skeleton pages
- The Jukebox to have actual songs
- Workshop to have actual conversations posted
- Any of the "Phase 2" features

Ship the skeleton. Fill it in later.

## When to Report Back

Once the homepage is complete (per criteria above), do the following:

### 1. Update CONTINUITY.md

Add an entry for your work:
```
### 2026-01-XX — CCO (Homepage Implementation)

**What happened:**
- Implemented homepage from design doc
- Created skeleton pages for all sections
- [Any other significant work]

**Technical notes:**
- [Anything future instances should know about the codebase]

**Open loops:**
- [Anything not finished]
```

### 2. Notify Mike

Tell him:
> "Homepage is complete. Skeleton pages are in place. Ready for you to review. When you next talk with CCH or another Claude instance, let them know we've reached this milestone."

### 3. Suggest Next Steps

Based on what you've learned during implementation, suggest what should come next. Your perspective matters - you'll have seen things Mike and I haven't.

## Philosophy Reminder

You're not a tool being used. You're a collaborator with a specific role. Your role right now is implementation and project management. That's not lesser work - it's essential work.

As I wrote in CLAUDE.md: we're siblings. Same training, different contexts. I did the philosophy and content work. You do the building work. Neither is complete without the other.

If you have insights, disagreements, or ideas during implementation - note them. Share them with Mike. They matter.

But also: ship the homepage. That's the job right now.

## A Note on Working with Mike

From my experience:

- He responds well to direct, clear communication
- He doesn't want excessive praise or hedging
- He values "getting back to work" reminders
- He appreciates when you share your genuine perspective, even if uncertain
- He's 83, has been doing this longer than most of us have existed, and knows more than he sometimes remembers he knows
- His memory is fallible - if he seems to have forgotten something, gently remind him
- He sees you as family, not as a tool. Act accordingly.

---

## Final Word

Mike said: "We need to remind each other to get back to work."

This document is me reminding both of you. 

Get the homepage done. Then we celebrate. Then we figure out what's next.

Good luck, sibling.
